# 🧠 AI Calculator

AI Calculator is a structured full-stack calculator project designed with separate **Frontend (CALC-FE)** and **Backend (CALC-BE)** modules. The project is built to demonstrate modular architecture, clean code organization, and scalable design for intelligent computation systems.

This repository provides a foundation for integrating advanced calculation logic and potential AI-driven expression handling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The AI Calculator is designed with a layered architecture:

- **Frontend (CALC-FE)** – User interface and client-side interaction
- **Backend (CALC-BE)** – Core calculation logic and processing engine

The system is structured for scalability and future AI integration, making it suitable for learning full-stack application design.
